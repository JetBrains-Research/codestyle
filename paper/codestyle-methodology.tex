\subsection{Research Questions}
We build the methodology for this study around two high-level research questions.\\
\textbf{RQ1: Are path-based representations of code suitable for authorship identification?}\\
\textbf{RQ2: Can embeddings for method changes be aggregated into interpretable fingerprints of individual code style?}\\
