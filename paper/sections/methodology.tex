\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Research Questions}
We build the methodology for this study around two high-level research questions.\\

\textbf{RQ1: What are the concrete elements of individual coding style, as perceived by software developers?}\\

\textbf{RQ2: Can elements of individual code style be extracted as implicit features?}\\

\subsection{RQ1: Elements of individual coding style}

With the diversity of angles and definitions of the coding style described in literature, there is no conclusion on the definition of code style.
