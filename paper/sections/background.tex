\section{Background}
The idea of extraction of fingerprints of programming style has been around in the research community for at least the last three decades. 
Prior research endeavours were mostly motivated by the needs of software forensics.

\textit{There is no research I could find that is motivated by the need to track style transfer in teams.}
