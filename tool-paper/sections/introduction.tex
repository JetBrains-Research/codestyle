\section{Introduction}

Recent achievements in methods of statistical learning have been lately making their way
to adoption in the field of software engineering.


The adoption of the methods is hindered by the significant technical work required for mining the representations of code.

In this work, we present \toolname.

By providing a convenient API for retrieving the path-based
representations and efficiently storing the extracted data, \toolname provides value for
both SE and ML researchers by allowing them to skip the time-consuming process of writing
custom mining pipelines.
